#Trainer Pad 1.0, codename "[Milon](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milon_of_Crotona)"

System for the management of sporting activities, customized and fine-tuned through the use of specialized tasks and sport specific modules. Add only the features you need and target your sport, activity, and role.

Deployed for iOS devices, now it can be used with iPhones and iPads (look for iWatch implementation future announcements).

{% include image.html url="/media/2014-02-26-Trainer-Pad/milon@05.jpg" width="100%" description="Most historians agree that Milon (6th-century BC) remains to this day the greatest wrestler and fighter (from any combat sport) the world has ever known. Milon of Croton became an Olympic champion several times during his nearly thirty-year career. His size and physique were intimidating, and his strength and technique perfect. Yet Milo was not merely a hulking wrestler; he was also a musician and a poet, as well as a student of the mathematician and philosopher Pythagoras." %}
